# Database Management App

## Back-end

First start back-end using the following command `npm run start-auth`  
The base-url should be localhost:3000

## Front-end

First install the relevant libraries, using the following command `npm install`.  
Second start front-end using the following command `npm start --port 8080`.  
The port number is irrelevant, it just needs to be different port than 3000, which is used by back-end.
